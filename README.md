# ItemStack-Builder
Create item stacks, books, player skulls, and banners with ease!
Contributions are welcome here!
If you want anything to be added, don't be afraid to comment in, I will try my best to implement that into this util!
Just a reminder, you may NOT claim this class as your own, and if you use this in a resource, be sure to give credit to me.

P.S. Because i suck at NMS.. could somebody that has good experience create a fork that lets you add item tag attributes? lol

Thanks!
